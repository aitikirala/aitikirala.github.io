# CO2 Emissions Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook written by [Jasdeep Ahluwalia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasdeep-ahluwalia/) and [Aarti Itikirala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarti-itikirala/) that analyzes vehicle CO2 emissions based on various features, such as engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption. The goal of the analysis is to answer the research question:

> "What are the most significant factors influencing CO2 emissions of vehicles, and how can we develop a predictive model to estimate CO2 emissions based on these factors?"

The notebook goes through the entire data science pipeline, including:

1. Data curation, parsing, and management
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Hypothesis testing
4. Machine learning
5. Conclusion

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the `CO2_Emissions_Canada.csv` file, which contains information about vehicle CO2 emissions and their features. The data includes the following columns:

- Make
- Model
- Vehicle Class
- Engine Size(L)
- Cylinders
- Transmission
- Fuel Type
- Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km)
- Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km)
- Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)
- Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg)
- CO2 Emissions(g/km)

## Dependencies

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- sklearn
- statsmodels
